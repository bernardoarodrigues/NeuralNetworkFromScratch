# Neural Network From Scratch
In this project, I developed a neural network in Python without any frameworks, such as PyTorch or Tensorflow. I did it to learn about a simple neural network's mathematics and background structure.
Besides, I trained the model in the MNIST dataset and finally tested its accuracy. The whole code is in the Jupyter notebook `mnist.py`.
